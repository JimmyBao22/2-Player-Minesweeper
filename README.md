# 2-Player-Minesweeper

## Purpose

The game of minesweeper is a childhood game that has been played on devices starting in the 1990s. The purpose of the program is allow friends to play the game minesweeper together, and compete on the same screen!

## Features

The major features of my program is that you can compete with a friend in this game of minesweeper on the same screen. There is a button that you can click which lists the rules of the game, and there is also a button to start a new game. The rules generally follow the same rules as the original game of minesweeper, except this one allows for two players. 
    
The game is designed the game such that each player plays for a certain amount of time (10 seconds). If a player hits a bomb, the other player automatically wins. Every block a player clears (flags don't count) earns them 1 point. This continues until the game is over, and the player with the most points wins. There is also a bonus for clearing the very last block. Ties are given to player 2. 
    
I believe that allowing each player to play for a number of seconds per turn rather than take turns clicking makes the game more interesting and fun. Taking turns per click would make the game too time consuming and not as fun. Meanwhile, taking time per turn would make it more competitive and fun.
